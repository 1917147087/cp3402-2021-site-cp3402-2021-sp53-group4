# Deployment
In Assignment2, we started with a discussion of the topic, a preliminary meeting on website design and how the group meetings would work. So we started to divide and record our work on Trello, going in that direction. After that, we started deploying our site on Wordpress.

We first created a Wordpress domain name and set up a website. On the main page, we invited all team members to participate in the common Wordpress website to edit our project. From the plugins, we have also downloaded a plug-in called Nicepage, which allows us to better serve our site.

Due to the restrictions of Wordpress, we found that the non-commercial version could not be uploaded, so we decided to upgrade to the commercial version of Wordpress after a group discussion.

Therefore, we upgraded Wordpress so that the team members could edit the website together. Everyone in the group worked together to speed up the improvement and efficiency of the website.

At the beginning, we could not link to Wordpress well because of the network. After several attempts to link to VPN, we finally succeeded in linking to Wordpress.

For project management, we all working together on wordpress. The should seperate and assign different part of job to different member. While one group member focus on theme, others should focus on posts and pages. WordPress does not allow two or more user to edit together.

For version control, we use the latest version to control and collaborate with our Wordpress. The linking problems, operational problems, and testing problems that can result from different versions are huge.

Also for testing and automation problems, every time we finished a project, each member of our team would test it to see if it was running properly or if there were any problems. Then we would make unified modifications, such as editing the website pictures, failing to upload them, and making incorrect sizes. Finally, integrate the website.
