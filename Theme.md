# Theme
The theme contains a main theme, which is responsible for the style and functionality of the main interface. The code is in the style.css file and function.php file in the root directory. The style.css file is divided into 15 sections, some of which contain subitems that are responsible for styling different content on the main screen. The general table of contents is stated in the comments at the beginning of the code, and there are comments at the beginning of every section of the code, allowing developers to select the sections they want to change based on the comments.

The header and footer function design of all the pages in the theme are located separately in the header.php and footer.php files in the root directory.

The theme contains blog template and post template for users to choose from. Users can use post template to publish posts and use blog template to integrate the cover content of published posts into a main page. Users can click any post on the page to view details. The functional design code for these two templates is available for developers to modify in blog.php and post.php files in the template folder. Templates contain part of the individual style design in files in the templates-parts folder.
