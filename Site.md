While adding new post, the latest would appear on the main page. It is recommended to add only post instead of pages. 

Our project contains only few pages to introduce and as a home page. Our content mostly focus on posts. 

We have mainly three categories: cake, bread and dessert. Adding each post should be categorized into on of these three categories. 

However, if in the future, the store is going to launch a new product or a new type of food that is not listed in these three categories; you may add a new father type category. 

If the store wants to separate those products in more detail. You can add child category under the father category such as French bread underneath Bread, etc.

Adding a new post needs at least one picture and information about the new product. You should host your picture online in order to reduce the loading time of the web page. 

We also use the plugin called NicePage. Its purpose is to control the pages. While making changes about the website such as information of the store, location, opening and closing time, you should use NicePage to edit and make changes.
